# Introduction

FurnitAR is a new way to shop for furniture. Imagine being able to see what a couch or chair looks like in your home, before you buy it. Imagine being able to see how much space something takes up in your room, and how it fits with other items around it. The possibilities are endless!

# How It Works

AR is a technology that allows you to see virtual objects in the real world. You can see how the furniture would look in the room before you buy it, or even create your own designs and print them out at home.

FurnitAR offers a new way of selecting furniture, which combines advantages of augmented reality with those of a mobile application.

It allows users to place virtual items in their own space and see how they would look in real life. It also provides an opportunity to get an impression of the size, design and functionality of the furniture placed virtually in one's apartment or house.

No longer do you need to be an expert in architecture or design; with our app, anyone can create the furniture of their dreams and see what it looks like before they make any purchases!

# Flipbook-like Paper Prototype

Low-fidelity prototypes are quick and cheap initial prototypes.
Sketching the interface and core UI components on rough paper and including real images allows the designer to focus on the important high-level UX design.
We chose to sketch each UI snapshot frame on a separate page and collect them in a loosely bound flipbook that can be easily flipped. This allows us to simulate the user interface for the user.
