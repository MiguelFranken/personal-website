# Flipbook-like Paper Prototype

Low-fidelity prototypes are quick and cheap first prototypes. By sketching on rough paper the interface and central UI components and incorporating real images the designer can focus on important high-level UX design.
We decided to sketch each UI snapshot frame on a separate page and collect them in a loosely bound flipbook that flips over easily. This allows us to simulate the UI for the user.
