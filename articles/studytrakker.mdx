# Prototype

In 2020, I participated in the [SemesterHack](https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/what-we-do/semesterhack/) hackathon for fun. As part of the hack, we created a prototype app.

> In November 2020, over 350 participants joined #SemesterHack 2.0. The online hackathon was hosted by the DAAD, Hochschulforum Digitalisation and AI Campus as part of the European Commission's DigiEduHack.
