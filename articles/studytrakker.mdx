# Concept

Learning is supposed to be fun. But what happens when you're using a method that's not working as well as it could? That's why we conceptualized the StudyTrakker application which is helping you how to make learning more effective by teaching you the strategies that have worked for me.

To help you track your time, there is a timer to keep track of how long you spend learning or working on a specific task. You could do this for each activity, each subject, and even each topic if you'd like.

When you're focused on your most important activities, you'll have time to do the things that matter most. Set up a realistic timer for your current task and work on it until it sets off.

# Conclusion

Studying is one of the most important steps to take in order to succeed in life. So many people don’t know how to study smarter and end up wasting their time learning things that don’t matter, or at least not enough for them to remember it later on (which defeats the purpose). But if you apply proven learning methods in your daily work/study routine—and the StudyTrakker app just provides some examples—then you'll be able to have more fun while studying and doing homework!

# Prototype

In 2020, I participated in the [SemesterHack](https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/what-we-do/semesterhack/) hackathon for fun. As part of the hack, we created a prototype app.

> In November 2020, over 350 participants joined #SemesterHack 2.0. The online hackathon was hosted by the DAAD, Hochschulforum Digitalisation and AI Campus as part of the European Commission's DigiEduHack.
