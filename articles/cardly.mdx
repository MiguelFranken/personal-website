# Project Background

It is often difficult to keep track of all the things that need to be done during the week. Especially in today's corona-dominated times, the organizational effort for one has increased a lot. Not knowing which Zoom, Google Hangouts, Skype or Microsoft Teams link to open at the right time to join a meeting, be it for a project one is working on or a meeting with group members for a module at the university, can be very time consuming and sometimes frustrating. With the right tool, the whole process can be made leaner, more efficient and easier.

# Concept

## Calendar Board

To solve this, we thought about the concept of an application that initially takes over classic task management tasks such as planning, tracking and reporting. In the application, the users work mainly on a board that contains multiple vertical lists in which they add, delete, modify and move around cards that represent some work to be done or some other information crucial for the user. In fact, the board consists of an infinite number of lists; exactly one for each day. By scrolling horizontally on the board the users can set the focus on other days.

Users collect their tasks and objectives, add the essential information into cards and assign them to a day by moving them into the vertical list for the day the user wants to complete the task. Of course, it can happen that one does not manage to work off all the cards in one day as it may have turned out that completing the task of a card a user has worked on takes longer than expected. In this case the cards left undone are added automatically to the next column overnight so that one has the chance to get reminded and work on them the next day. After this has happened too often though, the cards are moved to an archive list that is not directly part of the board. This should prevent the cards from annoying the user. The primary goal is to have only those cards on the board that are relevant for the user on each day. At any time, however, the user can put tasks from the archive back on the board if he decides that this is the right time to work on them.

## Note-Taking Functionality

But not only task management should be handled by the application but also note-taking. The application is intended to serve as a repository for much more information than tasks. For example, it would be interesting for users to be able to put not only task-cards but also information-cards on the board: Often during the day you want to write something down quickly so that you donâ€™t forget it. In this case users create new information-cards, fill them with data like notes or links to websites to read through in the future and put them on the board. The card will stay on the board for a while until it is put automatically into the archive.

## Real-Time Collaboration

Through the use of cards, the user can visualize and organize all his information, tasks and goals. All changes on the board are sent directly to all connected friends, colleagues and fellow students. It should be a fully collaborative board where users can work simultaneously.

# Simplicity
The whole concept picks up ideas from Kanban Boards, which are already used widely in project management. But the available tools are specialized and too complex for normal users. This conceptualized application tries to provide users an easy solution to plan collaboratively: The cards can be shared with others so that connected users can leave comments, select subtasks to work on, and mark them as finished as soon as they are. The application is intended as a platform on which colleagues or fellow students work together on tasks and exchange and record their thoughts with each other in small portions in the form of cards.
